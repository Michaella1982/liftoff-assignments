## Submission Instructions

### Overview
At the end of Section 2 I made a simple logging app that allows users to make a list of
items in a users record collection. I decided to make this project at the beginning of the course when, 
during a lecture, Olivia posited "If 'you' could be summed up in a website or app, which one would it be?" and 
the first thing that came to mind is Discogs, as I am an avid record collector and use it with frequency 
for both the listing aspect, as well as the selling/buying platform. 

I wanted to gain a better understanding of the mechanics of how CRUD apps work. In this project I will solidify my 
understanding of that topic creating a mock selling/logging app. It will allow users to track their collections
and purchases, to create, edit and remove sales/collection listings, and to be able to review and 
edit purchasing information. This application will be beneficial for anyone who wants to keep track of and/or sell their 
record collections.
### Features

-create a user profile and receive personalized feedback based on what type of profile the user has.
-Create a userID, and password.
--Create a subsequent forgot password/edit password capability

-Create, edit and remove entries with fields specific to the items being sold/catalogued as well as being 
able to upload pictures of items.

-View selling or purchasing history: Users will be able to view their purchasing history and 
a total of their expenses and transactional notes, as well as view history by different search 
categories. 

-View any stored purchasing information: Users will be able to view and edit their stored purchasing 
information.

### Technologies
Angular CLI
Bootstrap4
SASS 
MongoDB

### What I'll Have to Learn
This project will focus on DB/HTTP calls and returns. It will also be more focussed on/based in TDD, as it was something I didn't particularly focus on in the last project. Both of these are areas that I didn't feel super confident getting through, so I'd like to take a deep dive.
